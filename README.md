## About This Project
- This JavaFX-based e-commerce application was created to provide a feature-rich, maintainable solution for online businesses. With MVC architecture, it offers flexibility and scalability for future growth.

While it showcases the core principles of an e-commerce platform, I continue to enhance my skills and apply new techniques in more recent projects.
